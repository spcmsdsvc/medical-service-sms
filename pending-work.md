# Medical Service SMS — Pending Work

Everything started but not finished, plus anything deliberately deferred.
Companion to `changes.md`, which records what **was** done. This file records what is
**still open**.

**Update rule:** only touch this file when the project owner explicitly asks. It is not
maintained automatically the way `changes.md` is.

Last filled: 2026-07-31 (after the offline entry-point fix, `bfacf8f`)

**Where the work lives:** this repository, `medical-service-sms-railway`, working directly.
The sandbox at `Claude-medical-service-sms-railway` still exists, synced to `baefb63`, and
is no longer the default. This repository is push-by-default per AGENTS.md section 3, so
there is no free-experimentation area — if the sandbox is used again,
`git fetch && git reset --hard origin/main` there first, since it drifts the moment anything
lands here.

**Shipped, all pushed to `origin/main`:**

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `a0435f3` | Dashboard phase 2 — scheduler rebuilt as a dispatch workbench |
| `5d5b647` | Dashboard phase 3 — manager rebuilt around decisions and direction |
| `88b88cc` | Dashboard phase 4 — shortcuts consolidated, two unreachable sections retired |
| `5de1658` | Hybrid ratified, rodito exempted, developer preview removed |
| `187c2ec` | Journal correction (stale `scheduler.db` claim) |
| `ac78987` `2bc429c` `10b7f21` `a06e35e` | Reports renamed to TSR files, sidebar flattened |
| `23a58fc` | Approved plans must be recorded in `plans.md` and waited on |
| `3da143f` | LPR form signatures put back on their own lines |
| `709106c` | Offline schedule creation for field engineers |
| `9d4721b` | Recorded the unverified offline attachment path |
| `bfacf8f` | Add Schedule form opens offline rather than depending on cache luck |

Suite green at **334 tests**. Service worker cache at **`v56-offline-entry-point`**.

**A third journal now exists.** `plans.md` holds what was **agreed and is waiting to be
built**; `changes.md` what **was** done; this file what is **still open**. Approving a plan is
not permission to execute it — see `AGENTS.md`, "Approved Plans".

**The dashboard redesign is complete, and the hybrid question that outlived it is now
decided.** All four phases plus the ratification:

| Commit | Phase |
| --- | --- |
| `baefb63` | 1 — engineer, "Today First" |
| `a0435f3` | 2 — scheduler, dispatch workbench |
| `5d5b647` | 3 — manager, decisions and direction |
| `88b88cc` | 4 — shortcuts consolidated, dead sections retired |
| `5de1658` | Ratification — manager + engineer stacked, scope divider, rodito exempt |

**Note for the next reader on service worker versions.** `v49` was skipped in effect: this
repository is worked in directly and `9a2ad4d` bumped to `v50` from outside the session that
had claimed `v49`. If two streams of work are ever in flight again, read the live value out of
`app.py` immediately before committing rather than trusting what an earlier note in that
session recorded.

## 1. Open bugs

**None currently open.**

---

## 2. Queued work

### Create TSR on a schedule that has not synced yet — TO BE PLANNED

**Raised by the project owner on 2026-07-31 while walking through the field workflow. Agreed
to plan it later rather than bolt it on.** Not a defect — the current behaviour is deliberate
and fails cleanly — but it leaves the field sequence half-solved.

**The workflow that exposed it.** An engineer with no signal opens the calendar, finds no
schedule for today, adds one offline, does the work, and then wants to write the TSR on site
while the details are fresh. He cannot. He must wait for signal, let the schedule sync, and
only then create the TSR.

**Why it is blocked, in both places** — verified, not assumed:

- The schedule card's Create TSR button is gated on `shift?.id`
  (`templates/timeline.html:10043`). A queued schedule has no server id, so the button renders
  **disabled**, labelled "Create TSR unavailable".
- The shift modal's Create TSR button calls `openOfflineTSRDraftFromShiftModal()`
  (`templates/timeline.html:18419`), which reads `f-id` first and refuses with "Open an
  existing saved schedule first before creating a TSR."

Both refuse with a clear message rather than breaking, which is why this is a gap and not a
bug.

**The working path today, and it is worth telling engineers about:** open **Create TSR** from
the sidebar and write a **standalone** TSR. That is fully offline already. It simply is not
linked to the queued schedule, so someone reconciles them afterwards.

**Why this needs planning rather than a quick fix.** A TSR must reference a real shift id, and
a queued schedule has none until it syncs. Making this work means **dependent queue items**:
the schedule syncs first, receives its id, and the TSR queued behind it is rewritten to point
at that id before it is sent. That brings its own questions — ordering, what happens when the
schedule parks as a conflict and the TSR behind it is orphaned, and whether a standalone TSR
should be retro-linked instead. `9a2ad4d`'s creation token is the right precedent for the
identity half, but the dependency half is new.

Worth deciding first, before any code: **should the TSR wait for its schedule, or should it be
created standalone and linked afterwards?** Those are different features and the second may be
most of the value for far less risk.

### `/get_recent_activity` now has zero callers

`app.py:17856`. Its only caller was `fetchActivityLog()` in `static/js/app-dashboard.js`,
which served the `recent-activity` dashboard section — both retired in `5de1658`. The endpoint
itself was left in place because retiring a route is a separate decision from retiring the
markup that used it.

**Do not assume `/activity_page` needs it.** `templates/activity.html` carries its own,
independent loader against **`/get_activity_logs`** (plural, a different endpoint), and never
referenced `/get_recent_activity` or any of the deleted client-side helpers. That was checked
directly, because the opposite was assumed at first and written into a plan.

Same shape as the two open dead-route items below. Decide whether to wire it up or remove it;
if removing, drop its `/get_recent_activity` entry from the perf-log path list at `app.py:1172`
as well.

### Mobile tap target: `.dashboard-metric-link` is 25 px tall

At a 375 px viewport this link renders **25 px high**, below the 44 px minimum the frontend
baseline applies everywhere else. Measured in all three metric strips — `manager-executive`,
`admin-counters` and `engineer-summary` — at the same 12.16 px font size, so it is the shared
component and not one caller.

**Pre-existing, from phase 1 or 3, not introduced by `5de1658`** — confirmed by measuring it
inside and outside a `.dashboard-scope-personal` section and getting 25 px both ways. It slipped
through the tap-target checks in phases 1–4, which measured cards and buttons but not this
inline link.

It is the "Open timeline →" / "Open analytics →" / "Open directory →" affordance, so it is
genuinely tapped on phones. Fixing it means giving the link padding or a min-height inside
`.dashboard-metric-strip` in `static/css/app-dashboard.css`, and re-checking that the strip
still fits at 375 px without wrapping.

### `/get_engineer_dashboard_summary` has zero callers

`app.py:18488`. No references in any `.js` or template; appears only in the perf-log path
list. The same dead-route shape as `/get_scheduler_dispatch_intelligence`, which phase 2
activated, and the two hybrid endpoints phase 4 deleted. Decide whether to wire it up or
remove it.

### What's New — digest: first real send still not done — DO THIS CAREFULLY

**`CHANGELOG_DIGEST_ENABLED` is `true` on Railway** and the feature has been deployed since
`0447392`. **No digest has been sent to anyone yet.**

Before the first real send, in this order:

1. Open What's New → **Email digest** and read the **resolved recipient count** for each
   audience. That count is the safeguard; nothing else stands between a click and real mail.
2. **Send test to me** first — it goes only to the requesting admin's own address. Confirm
   it arrives and reads correctly.
3. Only then a real audience send, with the count confirmed.

Expect the resolved count to be **higher** than "accounts with a profile email":
`get_user_email_for_notification()` ends in a hardcoded username-to-email map (`diary`,
`hanna`, `kevin`, `jonamar`, `robert`, `rodito` → `@shimadzu.com.ph`), so those accounts
resolve regardless. Accounts with no resolvable address are listed by name in the modal.

**Known limitations, accepted rather than fixed:**

- **No idempotency.** Pressing send twice sends twice.
- **No unsubscribe.**
- The digest is **the latest 5 releases**, not per-recipient unread — someone who has read
  everything still receives a full digest. Making it per-recipient is considerably larger
  work and is deliberately separate.
- **No scheduled or recurring delivery.** Manual only, by design.

Both send paths remain available: audience mode (default) and the Settings-managed
*What's New Announcements* group. Naming a group without a mode still means the group, so an
explicit group send cannot be silently widened to the whole audience.

**Note:** the changelog carries entries up to `sort_order: 180` under the `2026-07-29` release
covering all four dashboard phases, plus a `2026-07-30` release with five entries for the
hybrid ratification. All are `is_published: true` and every one of the 2026-07-30 items is
`audiences: ["admins"]`, so a digest sent to engineers will not include them. A digest sent now
includes everything above.

### Stock inventory barcode scanner — pre-dates this session

From the 2026-07-26 handoff and still open. The physical scanner arrived but has never been
validated against production behaviour.

Collect before changing any scanner logic: scanner model, the exact scanned string, whether
it sends Enter/CR, the browser used, whether one physical scan opens one modal, whether
focus returns after save or cancel, and any exact API error.

Watch for: no Enter/CR suffix, the barcode field losing focus, rapid scans opening duplicate
modals, stripped leading zeroes, one scan producing duplicate events, branch context not
retained, focus not returning to the scan input after a modal closes.

Reproduce with keyboard input locally first.

### Spend reporting — deferred by decision in phase 3

Every approval model stores an amount and an `approved_at` date, but **nothing aggregates
money across documents** — no total by month, branch or engineer, and no `group_by` anywhere
in the codebase buckets by date.

Deliberately deferred as its own task because of three real pitfalls: `ReimbursementHeader`
has **no amount column** (totals must sum `ReimbursementRow.row_total`), travel mixes PHP
and USD via `currency_code`, and `LPRHeader` rows with `parent_module IS NOT NULL` are
embedded children that would double-count.

Note the old *Billing Visibility* panel was **not financial** — it string-matched shift
status, title and TSR **filenames** — and was removed in phase 3 for that reason. Do not
resurrect it as a money proxy.

## 3. Not yet verified

None of this is known broken — it simply has not been checked.

| Item | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| **Edge and Brave** | every dashboard phase, login redesign, sidebar, What's New, digest modal |
| **Offline behaviour against a real service worker registration** | login offline shell, dashboard assets, changelog assets. Real workers *were* registered through phases 2–4, the ratification and the offline schedule work (`v46` through `v55` observed), but the offline path itself has still not been exercised with the network genuinely down |
| **Mobile viewport (375px)** | the What's New filter/search row. Every dashboard phase and the ratification were checked at 375px; this row still has not been |
| **Skip link visual reveal on real keyboard focus** | layout shell |
| **A real digest email as received** | the HTML was verified in the preview pane, never in an actual inbox. Mail clients strip and rewrite CSS; check before sending to an audience |
| **Offline schedule attachments from a real device camera** | the least-proven part of `709106c` — see below |

On the skip link: the Browser pane does not composite frames, so CSS transitions never
advance, and its window is unfocused so `:focus` never matches. Disabling the transition
proved the element positions correctly, but the actual reveal was never seen.

### Offline schedule attachments — verify on a real device before engineers rely on it

The attachment path in offline schedule creation is **implemented and stored, but was only
ever exercised through the queue's own code**. Every browser check drove
`window.offlineSchedule.enqueue()` with a hand-built `FormData` carrying no files. A photo
taken on a phone has never gone through it.

**Why this one is worth a deliberate pass rather than assuming it works:** attachments are the
heavy part of the queue and the most likely source of a storage-pressure bug on a field phone,
which is exactly the device this feature exists for. A schedule that silently fails to queue
because IndexedDB refused a 12 MB photo is worse than no offline mode, because the engineer
believes the work is saved.

What to check, on a real phone rather than a desktop browser:

- A photo straight from the camera — several megabytes, not a test fixture — queues, survives
  a reload, and still syncs.
- Several photos on one schedule, and several queued schedules each carrying photos.
- What happens when the device is genuinely low on storage. IndexedDB rejects the write; the
  engineer must be told the schedule was **not** saved, not left believing it was.
- The blob survives a browser restart, not only a page reload.
- After a successful sync the attachments are actually dropped from the device
  (`discard()` removes them), or the queue becomes a slow storage leak.

The TSR queue already stores attachments as blob references and has been through real field
use; if this needs rework, copy what `templates/offline_tsr.html` does rather than inventing a
second approach.

### Offline schedule creation — what is now verified, and what is still not

**Verified on 2026-07-31 in `bfacf8f`, by driving the real UI against a genuinely stopped
server** — not by calling the queue API and not with the network stubbed:

- `/timeline` reloads from the service worker with the server down.
- **Add Schedule opens**, populated from the device copy of the engineer list.
- The real form fills and **Save Schedule** queues the schedule, with the banner shown.
- It survives a reload, and syncs on reconnect, landing in the database with its token.
- Replaying the same token returns the same shift id rather than creating a duplicate.
- A genuinely conflicting schedule parks as "needs your attention" instead of double-booking.

Still not exercised:

- **Attachments from a real device camera** — the section above. Unchanged and still the
  largest gap.
- **The pre-check against a stale snapshot.** It was verified against a fresh one. The case
  that matters is an engineer offline for a week, where the snapshot is a week old and the
  warning may be wrong in either direction.
- **Multi-day chains through the device queue.** Replay of a five-day chain is covered by
  `tests/test_offline_schedule.py`, but a multi-day schedule has not been queued and synced
  from the browser.
- **A cold device with no HTTP cache.** `/get_engineers` was observed resolving **200 from the
  browser cache** even with the service worker's runtime entry deleted, so the IndexedDB
  fallback added in `bfacf8f` was proved by forcing the fetch to reject rather than by
  reproducing a naturally cold device. Worth confirming on a phone that has genuinely been
  closed for a day.

## 4. Committing here — standing rules

Work happens in this repository directly, so every commit is one step from deployment.

Standing checklist for any commit here:

- [ ] `git fetch origin`, then `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD` to
      confirm no divergence before anything reaches origin
- [ ] `git status --short`, then inspect the diff
- [ ] Stage **explicitly, file by file** — never `git add -A`
- [ ] `git diff --cached --check` for whitespace, and `--numstat` to confirm no accidental
      whole-file line-ending rewrite
- [ ] Re-read `origin/main` **after** finishing the work, not only before starting. `9a2ad4d`
      landed mid-session from outside and quietly replaced a service worker bump; the only
      thing that caught it was checking again at commit time
- [ ] Confirm the commit contents with `git show --name-only` before pushing
- [ ] Focused commit message; push `main`
- [ ] Confirm only known local artifacts remain dirty: `scheduler.db`, `output/`, `tmp/`,
      and the 2026-07-26 handoff document
- [ ] A user-facing change needs a `releases.json` entry dated the commit date, or
      `tests/test_changelog_coverage.py` fails the commit

**`scheduler.db` is tracked.** `.gitignore` lists `*.db`, but that only applies to
*untracked* files, so **gitignore does not protect it**. Exclude it by name at every step.
Same for `.env`, which holds a real Brevo API key.

**Bump the service worker cache** whenever an `APP_SHELL` entry changes, or field devices
keep the old copies. Tests use `assert_cache_version_at_least`, so a bump never breaks them.
Currently `v56-offline-entry-point`. **Read the live value out of `app.py` immediately before
committing** — `v49` was claimed and then overwritten by a `v50` bump from outside that
session, and the stale assumption nearly shipped stale dashboard assets to field devices.

**Multi-line commit messages:** write them to a file and use `git commit -F <file>`. A
PowerShell here-string breaks on double quotes inside the message and silently reinterprets
the body as pathspecs.

**`Set-Content -Encoding utf8` writes a BOM** on Windows PowerShell 5.1. Rewriting
`static/js/app-dashboard.js` that way added a byte-order mark its sibling `app-changelog.js`
does not have — `node --check` passed and the browser ran it fine, which is exactly why it
almost shipped. Use `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $text, (New-Object
System.Text.UTF8Encoding($false)))` for any file another tool reads, and check the first three
bytes are not `239 187 191` afterwards.

**Do not combine `[regex]::Escape()` with `Select-String -SimpleMatch`.** They are mutually
exclusive: the escaped backslashes are then searched for literally, so every line containing a
regex metacharacter comes back as a false negative. A clobber check written that way reported
48 of 49 lines of a pushed commit missing when none were. For literal whole-file checks use
`[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText($path).Contains($line)`.

**Running the app for verification:** explicit `MEDICAL_SERVICE_TEST_DB`, never port 5000,
never `preview_start` name-mode, and stop every server afterwards. The Browser pane blocks
origins it has not registered, so open the app with `preview_start` passing the URL.

Two traps that cost real time this session:

- **`/static/` is `cacheFirst` and the service worker re-registers on every page load.**
  Unregister it and clear both caches after *each* asset edit, not once, or you will review
  a stale file and conclude the change did not work.
- **Template edits need a server restart.** Jinja caches compiled templates, so a changed
  `{% if %}` gate will keep evaluating the old way until the process is restarted.

**Test isolation caveat:** every test module pins `MEDICAL_SERVICE_TEST_DB` with
`os.environ.setdefault`, so under `unittest discover` the **first module to import wins and
all modules share one database and one Flask app**. Two cross-module failures came from this:
seeding an account named `rodito` makes `ensure_default_approval_routes()` write
`ApprovalRouting` rows whose NOT NULL requester FK then breaks sibling modules, and a
Completed shift seeded in one module landed inside another module's week-over-week window.
Both modules now clean up in `tearDownClass`. If a new module seeds users or shifts, it must
do the same.

---

## 5. Decided against — do not re-raise

**Editing or deleting a schedule offline.** Excluded from `709106c` by decision. Offline
creation is a new row and needs no reconciliation; an offline *edit* must resolve against a
row that may have changed on the server in the meantime, which is a materially harder problem.
Queued rows are refused by `canManageExistingScheduleForRow()` precisely so edit, delete and
drag cannot act on a schedule that has no server id yet. Revisit only as its own task.

**Offline schedule creation for schedulers and admins.** Excluded by decision. They create
schedules for many engineers at once, which multiplies the conflict surface, and they are
typically on a connection. The permission gate is `isEngineer` on the device plus
`can_create_schedule_for_engineer_ids()` on the server, which is re-checked at sync and is not
bypassed by the creation token.

**The Background Sync API for the schedule queue.** Excluded by decision; sync is manual and
on-reconnect, matching the TSR queue. Adding a background sync worker brings its own
reliability questions and belongs in its own task if it is ever wanted.

**Renaming `/offline_tsr_sync_ping`.** It now serves both the TSR queue and the schedule
queue, so the name is narrower than the job. Left alone deliberately — renaming a route used
by field devices to fix a name is not worth the deployment risk.

**Reviving the hybrid dashboard sections.** `needs-attention` and `team-intelligence` were
retired in phase 4 rather than made reachable. The manager watchlist already consolidates
severe overdue, aged TSR, blocked jobs, repeat equipment and at-risk clients into one
de-duplicated list with the engineer-workload drill-down beside it, and it renders. **Settled
in `5de1658`, so this is now closed rather than pending a decision** — their content is
redundant, not merely unreachable.

Correcting the record on *why*, since the earlier version of this file sent readers at the
wrong file: the fix was never the role-gating predicate. `hybrid_view` — `bool(engineer_profile)
and admin_authorized` — already existed and was already satisfiable; the retired sections had
simply been gated on `admin_view and not manager_view`, a different condition that no account
can satisfy. Reviving them would have been a one-word gate change. They stay retired on merit.

`hybrid_view` now has a real job: it gates the "Your own work" scope divider and the
subordination of the personal sections. `tests/test_dashboard_hybrid.py` asserts it still gates
something, so it cannot quietly become dead weight again, and asserts the *outcome* — that no
gate combines `admin_view` with `not manager_view` — rather than pinning a substring of
`is_manager_dashboard_user()` the way the earlier test did.

**A distinct hybrid view.** Considered and declined during the ratification. Every admin
non-scheduler (`jonamar`, `robert`, `kevin`, and `rodito` before his exemption) holds an
engineer profile, so `manager_view` and `hybrid_view` describe the same people and there is no
pure-manager account in the system. Building a third view would have meant inventing content,
not reviving it, with no unmet need identified. The scope divider addresses the actual
complaint, which was that the two halves of the page were indistinguishable.

**Narrowing `is_manager_dashboard_user()` so `kevin` and `jonamar` stop getting a manager
dashboard.** Raised and set aside during the ratification as a larger blast radius than the
problem warranted: the predicate also drives `can_view_manager_dashboard()`, and panels that
only suit a real manager are already gated on something narrower — the approvals block gates on
`is_approval_center_user()`, which is why `kevin` correctly sees it hidden. Revisit only if a
pure-admin account is ever created and its dashboard looks wrong.

**Coupling `MANAGER_PRIMARY_USERNAMES` to the other `'rodito'` literals.** Both
`APPROVAL_CENTER_MANAGER_USERNAME` and the hardcoded `'rodito' -> 'Manager'` branch in
`get_display_role()` (`app.py:7430`) happen to name the same account today. They mean different
things — approval routing, display label, dashboard layout — and unifying them would make a
change to one silently move the others. Left as three separate declarations deliberately. This
is the one place the "no duplicated username literals" rule from phase 2 does **not** apply.

**Inline approve/reject on the manager dashboard.** Considered in phase 3 and declined: it
would mean deciding a money-carrying request without seeing its contents, and it widens the
authorization surface onto the dashboard. Approving stays on `/approvals`.

**A change figure on current-state totals.** Phase 3 added week-over-week deltas to *flow*
metrics only (visits completed, visits scheduled, TSR completion rate). Currently-overdue and
currently-pending-TSR deliberately carry **no** comparison: a shift that was overdue last
week and has since been completed has left the overdue set, so any reconstructed historical
figure is systematically undercounted. That would be a wrong number wearing an authoritative
arrow.

**Clearing the service worker runtime cache on logout.** Authenticated HTML persists in
`RUNTIME_CACHE` after sign-out, so on a shared device an offline user could see the previous
user's cached pages. The owner confirmed on 2026-07-28 that engineers are issued **1:1
devices**, so the scenario does not occur in practice.

Two minor residual behaviours were accepted rather than fixed: `/logout` is itself cached in
the runtime cache, so an offline logout may not reach the server; and
`staleWhileRevalidate()` can return slightly stale HTML for same-origin non-navigation GETs.
Neither is an exposure on a personal device. Revisit only if loaner or shared laptops become
routine.

---

## 6. Pattern worth knowing before the next feature

The same defect appeared **three times independently** across the dashboard endpoints:
buckets of rows concatenated without de-duplication, so an item qualifying for two buckets
rendered twice. The scheduler priority queue, the manager watchlist and the hybrid attention
list each had it, each written separately.

All three are now de-duplicated by entity key with the highest-ranked reason winning, and
each has a test with a **positive control** proving the item genuinely qualified twice — so
the assertion cannot pass on an empty fixture. If you build another list that merges signal
buckets, de-duplicate it and test it the same way.

A related one: where a count labels a filter control, compute the count from the
**de-duplicated list and before any cap**, or the button will promise more rows than it
produces. Phase 2 shipped that bug and fixed it in the browser; phase 4's tests assert it.
